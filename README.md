Festive Sales Analysis using Pandas

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on festive (Diwali) sales data using Python.
The goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify top-performing products,
and extract insights that can help improve customer experience and sales strategies.

Project Objectives
- Analyze festive sales data to understand customer demographics
- Identify top-selling product categories and products
- Understand sales trends across age groups, gender, occupation, and states
- Support business decisions using data-driven insights

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm
- GitHub

Dataset
The dataset contains festive sales data with the following attributes:
- Customer age, gender, occupation, and state
- Product categories and product details
- Sales amount and order information

Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and data type corrections
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Grouping and aggregation to extract meaningful insights

Key Insights
- Identified potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups
- Observed that certain age groups and occupations contribute more to festive sales
- Identified top-selling product categories and products
- Sales insights that can help in inventory planning and demand forecasting
- Analysis helps improve customer targeting and marketing strategies

Visualizations
The project includes multiple visualizations such as:
- Bar charts
- Count plots
- Sales distribution plots
to represent customer demographics and sales trends.
